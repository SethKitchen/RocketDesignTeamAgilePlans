# Rocket Design Team

This repo is for issuing tasks to people on the team, that way they are aware of what they are supposed to accomplish and when it needs to be done. It's public so they can be held accountable.

To add a collaborator go to *Settings->Collaborators* then type the username.

To assign a task go to *Issues->New Issue* . Write a title and a description listing Who, What, When, Where, Why, How and assign it on the right hand side to the relevant team member. Under Project you can put your subgroup name or something else like "general SDELC." Feel free to add labels, projects, and milestones as well. 

In Projects, you can slide a card onto To Do or In Progress or Done for another way of visualizing the work flow.
